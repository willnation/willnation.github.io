<p>trying to acquire a sense of a free flowing brain again a brain that is capable of rattling off the feelings of the present time in a current sense of the word of time of right now the now the now is the present time in which we are right now because if there was any other time we would be able to feel or predict or think about the way that time feels worry is needless because it is not the condition of the future present because the future present remains unpredictable despite our best effort and there has been a significant reduction in time a to time b from the unlearned to learning but at any time it is of most importance to realize that the time you are existing in right now is the only time that exists you can bring the past to the present with stories but trying to bring the future to the present is a bigger task than what most people are capable of doing when the mind works faster than the hands the hands can't keep up and you wish that you could achieve an eventual blast of emotion or thought or internal to external but bringing the internal to the external is also a difficult task and how can you be present in time when trying to bring the past into the present through the action of bringing the internal to the external? Thoughts are on the inside words are on the outside. Anothers inside interupts your outside and your outside becomes contorted and re-internalized or at least small parts of it. Some things stick. Reading that everything is real it is just whatever an individual makes of the world. From this perspective there are many subjective realities and whatever story wins is the accepted apparent reality and framework that we exist in the present time. Science helps with this. This happened. This happened. Explain with math - this will happend most of the time. There are also fringe small cases luckly we live in a reality where everything is not exploding everywhere. At least we don't percieve these explosions. Biological and nuture drives these perceptions but the brain software that we choose to install on our brains drives the sense of these things too. Let the words flow back to the present. Not the same emotion. Need to read more fiction. Basis of reality, acquire a framework.</p>
