<p>Last week, I went back home to Indianapolis for a Thanksgiving break. On Monday before Thanksgiving, I visited an area in Fishers that included the Sun King Test Kitchen. When we got to the area it is a clean area with multi-use buildings, many resturants, apartments above the resturants, a hotel, and communial area with outdoor chess. The area looked like it had been built in the last 5 years. The area felt like it was a human colony developed on an alien planet. This spawned a thought and a weird state of mind that I have been stuck in for the last week or so - namely that so aspects of day-to-day American culture feel like we are humans inhabiting an alien planet. I guess it's colder outside right now, but I have started to think of the dependence on comfort being the "oxygen" we would need on an alien planet. Thinking of homes as little survival pods and cars as rovers further opened up my thinking. Which then led my brain to think of towns as small planets and cities as larger ones, using cars on highways to blast ourselves from one area to the next. From an energy perspective, I started thinking about Bucky Fuller's ideas of space ship earth, how we should treat the planet as a spaceship with limited resources and humankind as the crew manning the ship. Which led into further thoughts about each of our own life support units again and how it doesn't make a whole lot of since to be using a car which is most capable and suited for long distance travel (say 40+ miles) for those shorter distance trips (say &lt;8 miles) that make up (or should make up) a bulk of day to day commutes. The fact of the matter is that we don't actually live on an alien planet, 24/7 comfort is not as essential as oxygen, and there are much more energy++time efficient means of transportation that exist. Humans require exercise to live a healthy life-style biking is essentially double tasking if used as a means of transportation. If a daily commute is required by work, it would be best to live within X miles that allows biking to still be a feasible option. With that said, some locations might be more alien than others in the United States especially those areas that are designed for long distance spaceships rather than short-distance vehicles. Imagining cities as motherships, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to be dedicating space for long distance ships to move around within the confines of the mothership. It would make more since to have some kind of remote docking bay dedicated to long distance ships and those ships designed for short distance travel could only be utilized within the confines of the ship itself. This of course then begs the question, how can we move resources and large infastructure equipment around the ship itself - resources that are essential to human life like food, simple furniture, and small tools can be easily moved around with smaller cargo crafts, there are good designs for these. As far as maintaining infastructure we use a lot of large rovers that have bucket arms on them as well as being equiped with a large set of tools. One solution to eleminate the need for these large rovers would be decentralizing the infastructure so it became more human in its size - but this would not allow for the large motherships of the past because the energy environment has to be favorable for each individual, there is simply not enough natural energy penetrating a mothership's surface to provide enough energy for each individual. This all begs the question what is the optimal number of people per square-mile for colonies to have: a good sense of community and have the ability to be self-supporting? The only truly essential utilities for these communities is clean water and heat when needed. This would probably lead civilization to areas where there are cooler summers and temperate winters -- I don't think most people think in this way however. Family and friends is certainly a primary driver for where some people localize themselves. Jobs seem like the more prevalant reason for human location. I should seperate these things, they are all parts of life. There are a lot of competing reasons why a person lives where they do. I guess it all comes down to individual value systems. Maybe some people want their life to look/feel a certain way, or maybe they are trying to make some lasting impact on the world, or maybe they are trying to simply exist, or maybe they are looking for human love somewhere, or maybe they are invested in a certain hobby or interest that is only capable of being acted on in that particular area, or maybe they've got some really good family and just want to stick with them, or maybe it is a good church or good community that they heard of elsewhere and decided to move over there, or maybe it is because there is a job and they need money. There could be a lot of reasons. There could be a few reasons at the same time that conflict with one another. Baby brain. Hard to say, if you have not experienced things personally. It's really important to live the way you want it to be. This does not have to be 24/7 - it is impossible to not be a hyprocit, everyone is on some area of the spectrum for all personal traits I think. Basically, I think that people should write and think more so that is why I am writing and thinking this. Brain won't stop. Stop. Stopping.. stop. </p>
