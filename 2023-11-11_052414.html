<p>Do not press the up-arrow it will remove all the text you were trying to write.. major design flaw. I am brushing off the dust as the weather gets colder - the computer gives me something to do while it is cold out and writing is a good way to balance the time spent reading. I wathed an interview this week with Cory Doctrow talking about his book - The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation. Big focus on anti-trust and putting Big Tech as it stands under the anti-trust lense. How social media platforms get people caught etc. I started reading the book last night and he writes like vinegar unclogging my brain - very clear, moves fast, and all super interesting information. Omegle also shut down this week, its creator Leif K-Brooks wrote about the state of the internet today and the tiresome battle he had to fight to keep the site up. I wish more details were given in the post about the specifics about the attacks on Omegle, but Lief, like Cory provided some very compelling/refreshing words. Interesting, at the end of Lief's post he calls for readers to donate to the Electronic Frontier Foundation which Cory works for. The headline on EFF's page is: The leading nonprofit defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation. On the offensive side we have the folks who hold down all the open source software. Two companies that I follow right now that are very pro digital freedom include FUTO and TinyCorp. All good to have a look at. All this made me start thinking again about the state of the web now and its state in the past. If people are against social media, why do they keep adding content to its sites? If I want to stop watching YouTube why do I spend some nights glued to my screen after work? I think it is a a question of agency and friction. Big platforms today are like holes dug into the ground, each day the hole is dug deeper and wider and water is poured all around the edges to make it easier for people to slip in. The wider the hole the more likely you are to walk by it - think about results on a search engine. Looking up events in Indianapolis, I get results for the blue website, I better get on. Slippery sides makes it easier to fall in. All I need is an email to join, dang that's pretty simple, even better I can start watching YouTube without an account at all. Then the deeper the harder it is to get out or even worse other people are in the hole with you. Every piece of content that gets added to a platform makes the hole deeper. When you start to form relationships with people on a site, then you can sometimes feel like you are abandonning a group of people that you would not have talked with otherwise. Discord is a hole that I often visit - its easy enough to jump into but too shallow to stick around at least in the servers I am in, overall it functions more as a groupchat for me and some college friends. HackerNews is another one I visit almost daily, luckily it is not too busy and I will generally just stick to the first page and find an article or two - like those referenced at the top. HN is really easy to slip into - I have no account on it and luckily don't feel like I am missing out of on anything when I don't read it. Luckily when some vinegar words do come around I feel like my time spent there is worthwhile. YouTube on the other hand is a deep deep hole that has some slippery edges. A lot of the time when I stay on the site for more than what I got on for in the first place, the time feels wasted or leaves me fanticizing about a high agency reality where I have some farm, sheep, rabbits, and live a pastoral kind of life - maybe I'll get there (Possum Living is a good read about how to live with free time for cheap). Some YouTube channels I do watch weekly are Kirsten Dirksen which has exposed me to a lot of 'alternative housing/living' stuff, I generally try to avoid the videos on modern/city architecture however and another channel is Project Kamp which shows some people in Portugal setting up a commune on some farm land ~ I really should just be visiting their site instead of watching the videos. For blogs right now its geohot, Ran Prieur, and more recently some old Slate Star Codex. But consume, this is like me talking about what I have been eating for the last few months. Another thing that has been on my mind since watching the documentary is the Whole Earth Catalog - that thing is awesome and recently I learned that it has been digitized and available on wholeearth.info. That lead me to the book Human Use of Human Beings, which I recently finished and really puts together a lot of ideas I have read in other books in a single book. It's by Norbert Wiener. Also was re-reading Exiting Modernity (not the Acceleration bits) - this read through has put me into a bizarre move after each reading session, I knew it was going to kick my ass which it tends to do and I started implementing a lot of his recommendations while reading it before falling into holes again. It's all about agency, realizing that I am behind the wheel of my own life. Habit is dangerous. The fight for being present is hard. Addiction reduces agency. Addiction is a time suck. Ran something like have fun just don't get addicted. Keeping a sharp mind requires habits of their own. I also have been reading some Roald Dahl before watching the new Wes Anderson shorts. In Henry Sugar, a yogi is teaching his pupil and says, "If you will develop control of your body, then the control of your mind will be an automatic thing." This stuck and I will try to make it one of my bigger goals moving forward. Control of my body is something I do not have. I'd like to do a hand stand eventually, for now I am just trying to touch my toes. There are also a ton of pyschical (not purely mental) skills that I could pursue and this is the hole I really need to be falling into. I just have to keep up agency.</p>
