<p>Can't figure out why pip is not functioning for Windows. Went ahead and made a virtual environment instead. My guess is that it has something to do with multiple versions of python installed on this machine and a pip for a different version is in the path. Virtual environmments are the easy fix. I saved it to this repo too so it should be easy to use on whatever machine I am on. I'll just need to have git installed on the machine this is really easy on windows.. more easy than I thought, I can just use: winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget.. To activate the virtual environment I can use ./blog_env/Scripts/activate. python -m pip did not work for fixing my pip, virtual environment good</p>
