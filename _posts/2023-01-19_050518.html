<p>Imagined conversations are a waste of time and contort other humnans into people other than what they really are, for me at least. This contortion becomes more twisted in my brain before straightening itself out after the first couple of words are exchanged between me and the pior imagined person. This is escpecially the case with me for meeting new people or for people of perceived high-importance. Somewhere deep in my brain, I am probably thinking that this line of thinking is kind of like a "conversation dojo" were the mind can train for a conversation before it actually takes place. A dojo implies that there is some progress taking place, but mentally I get stuck in the same 4 or 5 lines - sometimes for hours (or maybe what feels like hours or maybe hours spread across many days). This is why it is a waste, it is good to think about points I want to make before an important conversation and prepare in some way; but it's much better to prepare these thoughts once before the conversation actually takes place. There are definite rules of effective communication, these are skills that I feel like I have been able to better develop overtime; but I have mostly been using these skills for more technical conversations - utilizing my "divine metaphors" and examples to help make information clear in other peoples' brains. Also doing checks to see if they are aware of a topic before jumping into too many details about it helps save sometime or allows me to not start from complete ground zero. But these things and topics are extremely impersonal -- more personal conversations where it relates to my real life are definitely more important and prior to those conversations can feel uncomfortable or too comfortable when I am talking and not realizing how it might affect my fucture. Words are really important. I don't always do a good job of keeping my mouth shut. I am often quick to answer; I don't feel like there is harm in correcting later - the issue is I might not always get that chance. I think real information is what is most important, the truth. But how can I relay that truth to others when I only have a set amount of experience and knowledge about things? Good thing we have the internet. Bad thing that the internet makes me lose touch with physical reality. But again good thing the internet provides the opportunity for everyone to learn and be level-set. Bad thing that people don't always use the internet to grow knowledge and capabilities. If you have someone you know that has information at their fingertips, why try to figure it out yourself when you can just ask them? This becomes a problem when people don't want to share for whatever reason (maybe the information is too personal, maybe they are safeguarding the information to perserve their career), luckily we have obedient machines that are able to answers to easy questions - the harder the question (like the two examples in ()), the less likely a human added it to the internet and can be answered by the machine in the first place. With that being said, the state of the internet right now (chat gpt specifically), is a generalist in most things and a specialist in some. The people are what are most important; and from what I have seen in my life so far, people are winning the war against machines by witholding information (but coders are screwed). With that being said, this might be just the case in my life I have limited experience right now, but getting things in shape to train a chat bot to be an expert of all things at a company still feels 15-20 years down the line.</p>
