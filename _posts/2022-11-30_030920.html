<p>Just learned about wireheading today, need to do some more reading on the concept but it was explained as the following: In the future we have some piece of technology that is capable of tapping into our brain to influence how we feel about/eperience the world. There was also conversation about making sure that the human reward structure is not modified. These concepts were relayed in a Briar Patch Observatory podcast with George Hotz about Simulation theory - I won't get into more than that, want to focus on how these concepts work in my own life. I spend a lot of time in front of a screen on weekdays - like I am sure most folks with white collar jobs do. This is essentially a life of look at big screen all day so I can go home and look at small screen. Not to that extent fully - but true for a large part of my reality, yes. Maybe some part of my life, especially those hours after work where I am "unwinding" I am essentially wireheading looking watching videos to modify my behavior, specifically a feeling of complacence. I can be self judgemental, but to deny that this is a feeling that I am seeking out would be dishonest. I talked about physical comfort being like the oxygen that keeps Americans persisting between spins around the Earth's axis, but maybe there is something to do with emotional/mental comfort as well. For some this comfort comes through learning new information for others it's remaining stagnant and learning nothing. There is nothing inheritly good or bad about either of these paths - from my lens the later might be a spiritual persuit that can be very enriching. A lot of what I watch online is the equivalent of noise in the grander scheme of things small nothing information that does not have any social capital for me to carry into conversations when meeting new people - things like clicking through recordings of IRL streams or watching a useless invention someone made adds very little to a conversation or information exchange with another human other than a "Did you see this?" and a "Yeah I watched this.." Maybe if there is something deep in our reward system for sharing someone else's experience via means of a video - I don't really know what I am saying here. But this all goes back to: What are the human reward structures? Further, how can we perserve these reward structures. I think some basic ones include: making allies, having a full meal, drinking good water, and having some comfort with shelter. These reward structures get more complex as we satisfy those that are easily obtainable and this might also mean that our reward structures fully modified in the large human civilizations we live in now.. My concern is that the complex reward structures might now satisfy everyone. If basic needs are satisfied what else should we be shooting for? My answer would be love - whatever form it comes in, I include some examples of love in why people live where they do. Also feel like I am grabbing at some other people's answers to an extent. Somewhere deep in my human firmware there is a clock that is always running protocol "Make life happy." Luckily, we can trick our brains into thinking we are happy - some with meditation, others with addiction. Really like that pursuit of happiness song, that's a good one. But yeah, need to read about wireheading more and human reward structures because these are just some first thoughts.</p>
