<p>Did not think of Freud much in the past few years, but started thinking about id and ego more after watching some of "The Pervert's Guide to Cinema" - this is a really good watch, I don't necessarily take all of the analysis to heart but it's an interesting doc. I had to stop watching the doc because films that I hadn't watched yet were being covered and I did not want them spoiled - which led me to watching a couple of David Lynch movies for the first time. Id and ego, ego is your face, how you present yourself day-to-day - your conscious mind -- id is deep desire something that keeps you going - subconscious mind (at least how I think of this). Thinking about yourself in this framework is kind of useful for being self aware and getting a different look at "why" you might have done something. Some years ago after doing something, I would often think about "why" I actually did something after doing it - but this kind of got my head stuck in a loop thinking that - if I am myself thinking about what I can't actually think about then am I really thinking about what I can't think about what I can't think about or am I still just thinking about what I can think about? In more simple terms using id and ego: Is your own id able to analyze your own ego? I think yes. This also brings up the idea of the conscious mind.. Does consciousness even exist? Some think that it does not. This is an interesting and fresh perspective but almost makes me feel a but non-human when I think in this way. But what about the term human and the weight that it carries? I these kind of thoughts about words really tune my brain into what feels "post-modern" Material things have certain meaning - immaterial things are more uncertain.. I think that the only way we can understand the immaterial is through what like to call "divine metaphors" which are those connections that can be used to help people make sense of something. This-is-like-that is how I think learning works for people (or at least for me) - This-is-like-that can be recursive as well (in a closed system) for a form of learning - example problems in math, physics, and engineering classes are examples in my life of recursive this-is-like-that scenarios. See professor solve for the supporting force on wiht some other force applied on a position of a beam, go home, homework is different length beam with different size force and you are solving for the supporting force. With the this: example problem in class and the that: homework problem at home. From what I can see, part of intellegence includes the ability of a person to make up the divine metaphors or this-is-like-that that. Comparing a human brain to a computer or database - having a large storages of "this's" or prior experiences allows us to come up with the "that's" being able to comprehend new information. There is also a lot to be said about trying different things when approaching new information or a new physical task. As a recent example, my chain on my bike started to slip yesterday - only once every 3 minutes or so. I tried fixing it last night and did not take a good learning approach - I was following a video about adjusting derailer but not in a this-is-like-that approach. There are other noises coming from the bike, I became concerned, overloosened the wire, did a full back derailer readjustment, took it on a ride, the problem was worse, slowly went through the video following the steps, waited till next morning to try the ride, rode the bike today and the problem was way worse than yesterday, called a hardware store to see if they could help, announced issue to coworkers, decided I should give self-adjustment a try again, adjusted the barrel, rode it outside during work to test, much better but slip on gear 5, rode bike home, problem got progressively worse during 7.4 mile ride, redid the adjustment at home of the barrel - shifting through gears more than I did at the adjustment at work, took it on another test-ride and it seems fine now but the shift between gears is a little harsh. The "break-through" that I had was learning what the twisting of the barrel actually does - when I looked it up at work. A lot can be said about ones material and physical condition when trying to learn something new. At work, I have a ton of space to work on my bike and a large parking lot to test ride. At home, the apartment is small, I didn't want to go out because it was cold out, I was working on the bike upside-down with the gear shifter on the ground so I had to akwardly adjust the bike to shift between gears, I had not eaten dinner yet, later in the night I realized I could have just had the bike upright and on the kickstand to do a lot of this work, also that taking the battery off the ebike has a very significant effect on reducing the weight and handling the bike without a stand. More to be said, I lost track.</p>
