<p>I wonder if there is anyone who has honestly written about how they think about computers rather than how a computer actually works. What are the divine methaphors around computers? Why did that guy at the party say that computers are just a counting machine and can never surpass human intellegence? Why do people think that computers are smarter than people? If the hardware surpasses the power of a human brain who is to say the software will keep up? What kind of effort is required to allow the software to keep up? What does it mean to learn independently? Can you learn something without it first relating to something that you already know? What is the first thing that bases a conscious mind into reality? Is this basic thing the prime directive of all life? Is this prime directive the meaning of life? Is the meaning of life to make life happy? Does saying make life happy imply that life is separate from the self? How can a being recognize that it is something other than what it thinks it is? What can we consider a being? What does it mean to be alive? What does it mean to have consciousness? People probably have answers for all these questions</p>
