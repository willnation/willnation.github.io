<p>Had something to say about convincing machine narrative generators but the text from my terminal got deleted before pressing enter and I could not fix what I wrote. Since I don't want to type a lot, I will keep it short. The implications of robo story tellers are scary, espicially when the stories are seemly believable. Since a machine could probably churn out stories faster than humans could create them - we could have a future with significantly more fake information than effectually true information. While there will always be sites with pretty reliable information, my thought is that these sites could be unknownly attacked with more fake information on the internet. Take wikipedia, often you will find references to old html webpages that a museum or library posted a number of years ago as a source. A bad actor could add a site with some true information that mirrors the simple old html webpage but could also have slightly false information about a topic on here as well. I doubt many people will try to do this but if someone wanted to add distrust to the Internet, this could be a way to do that. This blossoms a thought about using the Internet as a tool - but I'll discuss that when a majority of my time is spent using it as a tool rather than a modern TV and entertainment box..</p>
