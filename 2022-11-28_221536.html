<p>Now we can do the posting because the infastructure is setup just enough, I'll chunk through each of these html files in the future to add footers etc to clean up the look of the page, make it more consistent etc. That will be an automation task for the future. So far I have been able to make a simple work flow for making new posts using the post.py function were I am basically just re-writing the title to a time and date and then replacing the value of &lt;p&gt; with whatever I am typing in a console for input. It seems like the &lt;p&gt; will wrap which is a good thing. If I miss an update for the the posts however - since we look through multiple posts in the directory, it will sort the posts by whatever comes up first in the directory which is the one with the least recent datetime. More datetime testing to come because I don't know if I am going to be formatting everyhting correctly how to keep track of what time zone I am in etc. I could just do an end all be all and covert everything to UTC I think this would be the easiest implementation, and then I could just convert these ones that I already wrote by hand - this seems like the best solution. Also might make another update_index scripts that just goes through and sorts the &lt;a hrefs&gt; - that would be good as well. Whole world should be on UTC, I cannot imagine how many engineering hours are wasted on folks messing up conversions, business hours wasted getting on meetings too early or late, and overall life lost due to bigger concerns about "season-depression," sun setting earlier, etc. I'll update the code now - should be simple datetime conversion - the first three posts 2022-11-28 on hour 2100 will remain as Central Time. I'll make another post that just says "We are now in UTC"</p>
