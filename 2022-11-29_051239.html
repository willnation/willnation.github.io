<p>Now that the more desirable items are out of the way we can move on to some kind of purpose of this blog. In my younger days (ages of 17 to 19) I really enjoyed posting in my own world on Google Plus. A lot of this posting was mental free form gymnastics that I would perform for my those who decided to look me up on the web. Now at 25, I feel a need for a new outlet. I might go back to some of my freeform stuff, but now-a-days I have a greater desire to be understood. We'll see if I am still able to achieve that mental space that that I was once in, but I am very certain that it is emotionally undesirable - LCD Sound System Teenager. I also have more of a desire for control than I used to, which is why I am building this from scratch. At first, I considered going a Ruby-Jekyll route, but decided instead to stick to what I know python and hardly any html and build up my know-how from there. This is the first time I am doing webstuff since I was 20/21 and doing it on your own has always been more engaging and approachable for me than picking up a specific workflow/codebase. Next piece is preservation and distribution, I have been writing more in this past year than previous years of my life, but the bulk of this has been on paper. While I feel like it will be much easier to run into something physical I wrote than virtual for few, its also good to get the word out to the many. If I can engage people online than social capital will help perserve my thoughts and outlook better than scribbles on paper ever could. While I do not believe anything will persist forever, I have good faith in sites like github.com and archive.org to perserve anything I post there at least a little bit longer than sites like facebook, twitter, google which serve advertisers more than people. Also would like to give some background from where I am coming from in case people want to know more about me, maybe I'll leave that for an "About Me" page in the future. While I wish I could be a fully autonomous intellectual being a lot of where I am at right now derives from Ran Prieur, George Hotz, Bucky Fuller, James Ellis (HermitX), Ivan Illich, Lex Fridman, and Jaron Lanier - also read Teddy K's Industrial Society and Its Future for the first time recently; but that is a lot to break down. Shouts out to my loved ones and the internet for helping me find these folks - still have not read all of anyone's works/internet content, but all have helped provide significantly fresh perpectives of the world - whether its good or bad. Maybe we'll all get uploaded to the internet someday and my consciousness will be uploaded with some of my DNA; the machine is gonna have to know who I am somehow. It is probably best to be my honest self on the internet and have my own space to do that which is why I am making this blog. We'll see. Maybe best to reorient my perspective so I am writing more for myself. We'll see what I end up doing. Kind of funny cause I don't even have this going anywhere yet.. That's it, press enter</p>
