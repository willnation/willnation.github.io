<p>Cold air seeping through the dual paned window slowly passing over the back of my head cooling it down. Body fighting temperature keeping up well enough for now. Competing warm body, the furnace downstairs pushes warm air through metal vents up into the living spaces in the house. Other spaces exist where we do not live or at least spend much time living. Connecting our bodies with couches to take in something other than the energy that is present in the house and the cold outside body begging for equilibrium, the furnace fighting harder. Connected to couches the television flickers with exotic visions and sounds, those that are not common in a day to day experience. The cold wind howling outside. We are fine in here. Keeping the doors shut so we don't suffer the fate of the 4 wheeled metal comfort machines outside. Frozen. We are warm in here. Looking at screens to pass the time. Learning nothing new, because nothing new is important right now. No else to say what there is to do. Only yourself. Brain mushes slowly throughout the day, no new stories because you keep yourself inside, nothing to share. Let the television keep humming and bring in the feeling of Christmas into the house. The media aids. Maybe some past stories later. Or stories you have already heard. Wind howling outside. Venture into the nonliving space in the house to relive some old stories. Recover the box full of art and writings of another time to contemplate past feelings. Remember. Remember what it felt like to be a teenager for a second or two. Whip off the dusty box and go back to living. Maybe there is something else that you could do with your day. Feel like you have no real space of your own, to function and mess about with and make discoveries in a physical world. A desire to dig into the ground. The ground is frozen now. A desire to dig into the ground. You have no ground of your own. A desire to dig. You need a permit to do that. A desire to dig. Cannot presently be fulfilled. Watch other humans dig online. To an exitent the desire is goes a way. But something that will soon return. What creates compulsion or choosing to do something or anything at all. A desire to work? A drive to work on other work so you don't have to consider the pressing work? Using you instead of I again. Ownership. Would like to think of these to be others thoughts too. A shared human experience. Do others write in this way? Yes. You you you. I I I. As long as someone else is doing the same thing is there any difference in another person's eyes? That is a hard question to answer. Definitely a variation in the internal experience yes, but same external motions should be percieved as... More quality here that I am not recognizing "how it is said" and "how it is done" the unfortunate "how a person looks" are unavoidable parts that define the perception of another person by another person. Adjacent thinking. </p>
